# Samtræ for Fabricius Familien

A digital family tree application displaying the genealogy and history of the Fabricius family.

🌳 **Live Site**: [samtrae-fabricius.netlify.app](https://samtrae-fabricius.netlify.app)

## 🤖 AI-Powered Development

This project is **100% coded by AI agents** using a "vibe coding" approach - where natural language conversations with AI transform ideas directly into working code. No traditional programming was involved - just human creativity and AI execution.

### The AI Agent Stack
- **GitHub Copilot** - Primary coding agent
- **Natural Language Programming** - All features described in plain language
- **Conversational Development** - Features emerge through collaborative AI discussions
- **Zero Manual Coding** - Every line generated by AI understanding human intent

## About

This application provides an interactive way to explore the Fabricius family lineage, featuring:

- **Football Card-Style Profiles**: Person cards designed like sports trading cards
- **Interactive Family Tree**: Browse through generations of the Fabricius family
- **Detailed Person Profiles**: View biographical information, dates, and relationships
- **Rich Genealogical Data**: Birth/death dates, locations, occupations, and life events
- **Relationship Mapping**: Explore connections between family members
- **Historical Documentation**: Sources and notes for genealogical research

## Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies:
- **Astro** - Static site generation with islands architecture
- **React** - Interactive components and islands
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe family tree data structures
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful, accessible UI components

## Development

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

## Family Data Structure

The application uses a comprehensive TypeScript type system for modeling family relationships, supporting:
- Multiple marriages and partnerships
- Flexible date handling (partial dates, estimated dates)
- Rich biographical information
- Privacy controls for living family members
- Data validation and integrity checking

See `/src/types/family.ts` for the complete type definitions.

## 🎯 The Vibe Coding Philosophy

This project demonstrates the power of **AI-human collaboration** in modern software development:

- **Idea → Reality**: Concepts described in natural language become functional features
- **Iterative Refinement**: AI agents continuously improve code through conversation  
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Complex genealogical data structures emerged from simple requests
- **Rapid Prototyping**: From concept to working family tree in a single coding session
- **Zero Barriers**: No need for traditional programming knowledge - just clear communication

*The future of coding is conversational.* 🚀

## 🤝 Contributing to the AI-Powered Family Tree

We welcome contributions to this AI-driven project! Whether you want to add features, fix bugs, or improve designs, here's how to collaborate with our AI agents safely and effectively.

### 🎯 **Preferred Contribution Method: Issues → AI Agents**

**The best way to contribute is by creating detailed issues that AI agents can implement:**

1. **🚀 [Create a Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ai-agent-feature-request.md)**
   - Use natural language to describe what you want
   - Provide context and examples
   - Let AI agents do the coding magic ✨

2. **🐛 [Report Bugs](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ai-agent-bug-fix.md)**
   - Include steps to reproduce
   - Add screenshots and error messages
   - AI agents will debug and fix

3. **🎨 [Request Design Changes](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ai-agent-design-enhancement.md)**
   - Describe visual improvements
   - Share inspiration and references
   - AI agents will implement the design

### 💡 **Why Issues Work Best:**

- **AI agents excel at implementation** when given clear requirements
- **Conversational prompts** produce better results than code reviews
- **Maintains the "vibe coding" philosophy** of this project
- **Protects the master branch** from experimental changes
- **Preserves the AI-first development approach**

### 🔧 **Alternative: Pull Request Workflow**

**If you prefer to code yourself, please use this safe workflow to prevent "AI nuking" the master branch:**

#### **Step 1: Fork & Branch**
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my_fam.git
cd my_fam

# Create a feature branch (NEVER work on master!)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

#### **Step 2: Develop Safely**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Make your changes...
# Test thoroughly!
```

#### **Step 3: Submit Pull Request**
```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add: clear description of changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Open a Pull Request on GitHub
# ✅ Target: master branch
# ✅ Include: Screenshots, testing notes, impact assessment
```

### 🛡️ **Master Branch Protection**

**Why we protect master:**
- **AI agents can be unpredictable** - experimental code needs review
- **Maintains stability** for the live site at samtrae-fabricius.netlify.app  
- **Preserves the project's AI-first identity** and code quality
- **Allows safe experimentation** in feature branches

**All changes to master require:**
- ✅ Pull request review
- ✅ Successful CI/CD checks  
- ✅ Manual testing verification
- ✅ AI agent approval (for AI-generated code)

### 📋 **Contribution Guidelines**

#### **For Issue Creators:**
- **Be conversational** - Write prompts like you're talking to a developer
- **Provide context** - Explain why the feature matters
- **Include examples** - Screenshots, links, or descriptions of similar features
- **Think user-first** - How does this help people explore family history?

#### **For Code Contributors:**
- **Follow TypeScript best practices** - This project is strongly typed
- **Use Tailwind CSS** - No custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- **Leverage shadcn/ui components** - Consistent design system
- **Test on mobile** - Many users browse family trees on phones
- **Consider Danish context** - This is for Danish family history

#### **Testing Your Changes:**
```bash
# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Test on different screen sizes
# Verify accessibility
# Check console for errors
# Test the person cards functionality
```

### 🎨 **Design System**

**Current components:**
- Person cards (football card style)
- Responsive grid layout
- Danish language support
- Blue/pink gender color coding
- shadcn/ui component library

**When adding new UI:**
- Follow existing color schemes
- Maintain accessibility standards  
- Keep the "trading card" aesthetic
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
