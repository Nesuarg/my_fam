## 🎯 Writing Effective AI Prompts

### **The Golden Rules:**

1. **Be Conversational** 🗣️
   - Write like you're talking to a human developer
   - Use natural language, not formal specifications
   - Example: "I'd love to see a family tree visualization where clicking on a person expands their relatives"

2. **Provide Context** 🧠
   - Explain WHY you need this feature
   - Describe the user problem it solves
   - Mention how it fits into the bigger picture

3. **Show Examples** 🖼️
   - Reference similar features from other apps
   - Include screenshots or mockups if possible
   - Link to inspiration or design patterns

4. **Break Complex Ideas Down** 🔧
   - Split big features into smaller, focused requests
   - Each issue should tackle one clear problem
   - Link related issues together

5. **Include Technical Hints** 💡
   - Mention relevant files if you know them
   - Suggest components or libraries to use  
   - Note any constraints or requirements

### **Example of Great AI Prompts:**

✅ **Good:**
> "Create an interactive family timeline that shows major life events (births, marriages, deaths) for the Fabricius family. Users should be able to scroll through different decades and click on events to see more details. Something similar to how Facebook's timeline works, but for genealogy. The data is already in our Person type with lifeEvents array."

❌ **Not Great:**
> "Add timeline feature"

## 🚀 Contributing Workflow

1. **Open an issue** using the appropriate template
2. **Tag it** with `ai-agent` label (auto-added by templates)  
3. **AI agent reviews** and asks clarifying questions if needed
4. **Implementation happens** through AI-human collaboration
5. **Review and iterate** until perfect
6. **Merge and celebrate** 🎉

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **One feature per issue** - Keep it focused
- **Use screenshots** - Visual context helps immensely  
- **Think user-first** - How does this help people explore their family tree?
- **Consider mobile** - Many users will be on phones/tablets
- **Danish context** - Remember this is for Danish family history
